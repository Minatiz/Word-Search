## Problem Sizes

The project supports three different problem sizes that you can work with:

* **0: 100x100 grid & 1k wordlist**
* **1: 1000x1000 grid & 10k wordlist**
* **2: 10000x10000 grid & 1m wordlist**

The problem size is controlled by the variable `PROBLEM_SIZE`, which can be changed inside the `sequential.py` or `parallel.py` file.

## How to run 

**1. For Sequential Program:** `python3 sequential.py`

**2. For Parallel Program:** `python3 parallel.py`
